# App challenges

# ---> 1. need to be able to navigate around to separate pages in our app --> 2. need to allow a user to login/logout --> 3. need to handle forms in Redux ---> 4. Need to master CRUD (create, read, update and destroy) operations in React/Redux ---> 5. Erros will likely occur! need good error handling

# react-router --> core navigation lib - we don't install this manually

# react-router-dom ---> navigation for dom-based apps(we want this)

# react-router-navite --> navigation for react-native app

# react-router-reduc ---> binding between react router and redux (not necessary)

# using <a> and Href !!Bad Navigation!! Browser receives index file, dumps old HTML it was showing (including all of your React/Redux state data!)

# using <link> what we want ---> 1. User wants to navigate to another app in our app ---> 2. User clicks a link tag ---> 3. React Router prevents the browser from navigating to the new page and fetching new index.html file --> 4. URL still changes --> 5. History sees updated URL, takes URL and sends it to BrowserRouter --> 6. BrowserRouter communicates the URL to Route Components ---> 7. React components rerender to show new set of components

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
